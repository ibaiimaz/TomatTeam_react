## History

This web app is based in a project created by the Tomatina Team in The Meleeton2017.

It was originaly developed in Django + Djangorest for the backend and VueJS + Vuematerial for the frontend.

I've move it to a more familiar stack and I'm developing it with Asp.Net Core Web API and React + Redux
